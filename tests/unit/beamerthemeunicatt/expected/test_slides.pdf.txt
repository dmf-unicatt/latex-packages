Some results (I)

Theorem 1 (Pythagoras)
For a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c, we have

                                                     a2 + b2 = c2 .

An illustration of the Pythagorean theorem is shown in Figure 2.




                                                 b              c

Some results (II)

Definition 3 (Prime Number)
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Example 4 (Small Primes)
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.

Lemma 5 (Divisibility Property)
If a prime p divides the product ab, then p divides a or p divides b.

Corollary 6
If a prime p divides the product abc, then p divides a, or p divides b, or p divides c.

Exercise 7
Prove Corollary 6 using Lemma 5.

Some results (III)

Proposition 8 (Infinitude of Primes)
There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Proof
Assume there are finitely many primes p1 , . . . , pn . Consider

                                                  P = p1 p2 · · · pn + 1.

Then P is either prime itself or divisible by a prime not in the list. In either case, there exists a prime
not in {p1 , . . . , pn }, contradicting finiteness. Hence, there are infinitely many primes.

Remark 9 (Euclid)
The proof of the infinitude of primes, originally due to Euclid, is one of the oldest and most elegant
arguments in mathematics.

Example 10 (Non-Prime Numbers)
The integers 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not prime, since each can be expressed as a product of smaller integers.

Some results (IV)

Exercise 11
Go to Jupyter and run Exercise 11.

Remark 12
In Exercise 11 we could have also used a larger number, say 8, 9 or 10. See Exercise 13.

Exercise 13 (Variant of Exercise 11)
Go to Jupyter and run Exercise 13.

Homework 1
Prove that 12 is not a prime number.
