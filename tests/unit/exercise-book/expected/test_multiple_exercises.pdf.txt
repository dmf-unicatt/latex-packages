                   1.1    First subsection
      sec:1.1.1
           ex:1
                   Exercise 1 (Simple Addition). What is 2 + 2?
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:1, counter value 13) .


                   2     Second section
        sec:1.2
                   2.1    A subsection
ex:2020-01-14-01
       sec:1.2.1
            ex:2
                   Exercise 2 (January 14, 2020). What is 3 + 3?
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:2, counter value 14) .

                   2.2    Another subsection
      sec:1.2.2
           ex:3
                   Exercise 3. What is 4 + 4?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 1(Links to label ex:1, counter value 1) .
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:3, counter value 15) .
ex:2020-01-15-01
            ex:4
                   Exercise 4 (January 15, 2020). What is 5 + 5?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 2(Links to label ex:2020-01-14-01, counter value 2) .
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:4, counter value 16) .

                   2.3    A third subsection
ex:2021-01-16-01
       sec:1.2.3
            ex:7
                   Exercise 5 (January 16, 2021). What is 7 + 7? This replaced the exercise
                   from 2020, which was asking about 6 + 6: look in the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:7, counter value 17) .
ex:2022-01-16-01
            ex:8
                   Exercise 6 (January 16, 2022). What is 8 + 8? This will replace the exercise
                   from 2023, which will ask about 9 + 9: look in the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:8, counter value 18) .
ex:2024-01-16-01
           ex:10
                   Exercise 7 (January 16, 2024). What is 10+10? This exercise was supposed
                   to be replaced by the exercise from 2025, namely Exercise 8(Links to label ex:2025-01-16-01, counter value 11) ,
                   but such replacement will not happen until 2026.
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:10, counter value 19) .
ex:2025-01-16-01
           ex:11
                   Exercise 8 (January 16, 2025). What is 11 + 11? This exercise will be
                   replaced by the exercise from 2026, but such replacement will happen only in
                   2026. Unfortunately I can’t show usage of \cref{ex:2026-01-16-01} here,
                   because this exercise does not exist yet, but look into the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:11, counter value 20) .
