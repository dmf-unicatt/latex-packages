      sec:1.2.2
           ex:3
                   Exercise 3. What is 4 + 4?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 1[3] .
                   Go to: solution[4] .
ex:2020-01-15-01
            ex:4
                   Exercise 4 (January 15, 2020). What is 5 + 5?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 2[5] .

ex:2021-01-16-01
       sec:1.2.3
            ex:7
                   Exercise 5 (January 16, 2021). What is 7 + 7? This replaced the exercise
                   from 2020, which was asking about 6 + 6: look in the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution[7] .
ex:2022-01-16-01
            ex:8
                   Exercise 6 (January 16, 2022). What is 8 + 8? This will replace the exercise
                   from 2023, which will ask about 9 + 9: look in the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution[8] .
ex:2024-01-16-01
           ex:10
                   Exercise 7 (January 16, 2024). What is 10 + 10? This exercise was sup-
                   posed to be replaced by the exercise from 2025, namely Exercise 8[9] , but such
                   replacement will not happen until 2026.
                   Go to: solution[10] .
ex:2025-01-16-01
           ex:11
                   Exercise 8 (January 16, 2025). What is 11 + 11? This exercise will be
                   replaced by the exercise from 2026, but such replacement will happen only in
                   2026. Unfortunately I can’t show usage of \cref{ex:2026-01-16-01} here,
                   because this exercise does not exist yet, but look into the source code to find it.
                   Go to: solution[11] .
          ex:13
                   Exercise 9. This is an extra exercise that refers to chapter A[12] , chapters A
                   and B[13] , chapters A to C[14] , but also to chapter A[15] and chapters A and B[16]
                   and chapters A to C[17] with ‘and’ instead of commas. Furthermore it refers
                   to Exercise 1[18] , Exercises 1 and 2[19] , Exercises 1, 2 and 6[20] , but also to
                   Exercise 1[21] and Exercises 1 and 2[22] and Exercises 1, 2 and 6[23] with ‘and’
                   instead of commas.
