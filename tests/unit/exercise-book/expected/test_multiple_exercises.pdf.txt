                   Exercise 7 (January 16, 2021). What is 7 + 7? This replaced the exercise from 2020, which was
                   asking about 6 + 6: look in the source code to find it.

                   will ask about 9 + 9: look in the source code to find it.

           ex:12
                   Exercise 9 (January 16, 2024). What is 10 + 10? This exercise was supposed to be replaced by
                   the exercise from 2025, namely Exercise 10[11] , but such replacement will not happen until 2026.

           ex:13

                   from 2026, but such replacement will happen only in 2026. Unfortunately I can’t show usage of
                   \cref{ex:2026-01-16-01} here, because this exercise does not exist yet, but look into the source

           ex:15
                   Exercise 11. This is an extra exercise that refers to chapter A[14] , chapters A and B[15] , chapters A
                   to C[16] , but also to chapter A[17] and chapters A and B[18] and chapters A to C[19] with ‘and’ instead
