                   1.1     First subsection
       sec:1.1.1
            ex:1
                   Exercise 1 (Simple Addition). What is 2 + 2?
                     Please answer.

        sec:1.2

ex:2020-01-14-01
       sec:1.2.1
            ex:2
                   Exercise 2 (January 14, 2020). What is 3 + 3?

                   2.2     Another subsection
       sec:1.2.2
            ex:3
                   Exercise 3. What is 4 + 4?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 1[3] .
                   Go to: solution[4] .
ex:2020-01-15-01
            ex:4
                   Exercise 4 (January 15, 2020). Discuss this code
              1    5 + 5
                   10
                     This exercise is very different from Exercise 2[5] .

                   2.3     A third subsection
ex:2021-01-16-01
       sec:1.2.3
            ex:7
                   Exercise 5 (January 16, 2021). What is 7 + 7? This replaced the exercise from 2020, which was
                   asking about 6 + 6: look in the source code to find it.
                      Sample code
              1    7 + 7
                   14
                   Go to: solution[7] .
ex:2022-01-16-01
            ex:8
                   Exercise 6 (January 16, 2022). What is 8 + 8? This will replace the exercise from 2023, which
                   will ask about 9 + 9: look in the source code to find it.
                       Sample code

              1    8 + 8
                   16
                   Go to: solution[8] .
ex:2024-01-16-01
           ex:10
                   Exercise 7 (January 16, 2024). What is 10 + 10? This exercise was supposed to be replaced by
                   the exercise from 2025, namely Exercise 8[9] , but such replacement will not happen until 2026.
                      Sample code
              1    10 + 10
                   20
                   Go to: solution[10] .
ex:2025-01-16-01
           ex:11
                   Exercise 8 (January 16, 2025). What is 11 + 11? This exercise will be replaced by the exercise
                   from 2026, but such replacement will happen only in 2026. Unfortunately I can’t show usage of
                   \cref{ex:2026-01-16-01} here, because that exercise does not exist yet, but look into the source
                   code to find it.
                      Sample code

              1    11 + 11
                   22

sol:2020-01-15-01
            sol:4

                       Unfortunately I can’t show usage of \cref{sol:2026-01-16-01} here, because that points to
                    the solution of an exercise that does not exist yet.

        sec:3.2.1
            add:2
                    Exercise 2[43] .   You can proceed as before, say

               1    3 + 3
                    6
                        Still, there is also a more elaborated solution with variables:
               2    a = 3
               3    b = 3
               4    a + b

                    6
