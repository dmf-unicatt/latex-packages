           ex:3
                   Exercise 3. What is 4 + 4?
                     This exercise is really similar to Exercise 1(Links to label ex:1, counter value 1) .
                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:3, counter value 15) .
ex:2020-01-15-01

              1    5 + 5


                   10

                     This exercise is very different from Exercise 2(Links to label ex:2020-01-14-01, counter value 2) .

            ex:7
                   Exercise 5 (January 16, 2021). What is 7 + 7? This replaced the exercise
                   from 2020, which was asking about 6 + 6: look in the source code to find it.
                      Sample code
              1    7 + 7

            ex:8
                   Exercise 6 (January 16, 2022). What is 8 + 8? This will replace the exercise
                   from 2023, which will ask about 9 + 9: look in the source code to find it.
                      Sample code
              1    8 + 8

                   16

                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:8, counter value 18) .
ex:2024-01-16-01
           ex:10
                   Exercise 7 (January 16, 2024). What is 10+10? This exercise was supposed
                   to be replaced by the exercise from 2025, namely Exercise 8(Links to label ex:2025-01-16-01, counter value 11) ,
                   but such replacement will not happen until 2026.
                       Sample code
              1    10 + 10

                   20

                   Go to: solution(Links to label sol:10, counter value 19) .

           ex:11
                   Exercise 8 (January 16, 2025). What is 11 + 11? This exercise will be
                   replaced by the exercise from 2026, but such replacement will happen only in
                   2026. Unfortunately I can’t show usage of \cref{ex:2026-01-16-01} here,
                   because that exercise does not exist yet, but look into the source code to find
                   it.
                       Sample code
              1    11 + 11
