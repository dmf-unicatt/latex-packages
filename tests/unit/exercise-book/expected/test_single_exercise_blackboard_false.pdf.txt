                   Exercise 1 (January 16, 2026). What is 12 + 12?
                      This is an exercise that in test_multiple_exercises.tex was not shown,
                   because its academic year is in the future. However, in this file we use the
                   blackboard=false, that automatically set academic-year to a very distant
                   year, and adds a watermark on the background.
