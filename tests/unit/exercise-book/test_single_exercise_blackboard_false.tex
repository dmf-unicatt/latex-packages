\begin{exercise}[examdate={January 16, 2026}, examproblemnumber={1}, examproblemid={2026-01-16-01}]
  What is \(12 + 12\)?

  This is an exercise that in \texttt{test\_multiple\_exercises.tex} was not shown, because its academic year is in the future. However, in this file we use the \texttt{blackboard=false}, that automatically set \texttt{academic-year} to a very distant year, and adds a watermark on the background.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \(12 + 12 = 24\).
\end{solution}

\begin{additionalinformation}
Open python and type 12 + 12
\end{additionalinformation}
