\frametitle{Including aux files}

\begin{itemize}
\item In book mode aux the user is expected to provide a \verb|\includechapter| command for every chapter. This will generate the aux files that will be used in presentation mode too. To speed up the compilation the user can temporarily comment out some chapters, or include them only as aux files (provided that those files were generated by a previous compilation) by providing the optional argument \verb|aux-only|.
\item In presentation mode the command \verb|\includechapter| automatically includes aux files for all chapters, even when a single chapter is included. The command does not accept any optional argument.
\end{itemize}
