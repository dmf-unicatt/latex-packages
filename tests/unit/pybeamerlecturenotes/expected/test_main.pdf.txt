Theorem-like environments

Theorem 3.1 (Pythagoras). For a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse
c, we have
                             a2 + b2 = c2 .
                                                                               ♦
   An illustration of the Pythagorean theorem is shown in Figure 3.2.
Definition 3.3 (Prime Number). A prime number is an integer greater than 1
that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.                  ♦
Example 3.4 (Small Primes). The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.    ♦
Lemma 3.5 (Divisibility Property). If a prime p divides the product ab, then
p divides a or p divides b.                                                ♦
Corollary 3.6. If a prime p divides the product abc, then p divides a, or p
divides b, or p divides c.                                                ♦
Exercise 3.7. Prove Corollary 3.6 using Lemma 3.5.                             ♦
Proposition 3.8 (Infinitude of Primes). There are infinitely many prime num-
bers.                                                                      ♦

Figure 3.2: A right triangle illustrating the Pythagorean theorem: a2 + b2 = c2 .
    Proof. Assume there are finitely many primes p1 , . . . , pn . Consider

                                    P = p1 p2 · · · pn + 1.

    Then P is either prime itself or divisible by a prime not in the list. In either
    case, there exists a prime not in {p1 , . . . , pn }, contradicting finiteness. Hence,
    there are infinitely many primes.
    Remark 3.9 (Euclid). The proof of the infinitude of primes, originally due to
    Euclid, is one of the oldest and most elegant arguments in mathematics.     ♦
    Example 3.10 (Non-Prime Numbers). The integers 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not prime,
    since each can be expressed as a product of smaller integers.             ♦
    Exercise 3.11. As stated in Example 3.10, we verify that 6 is not prime by
    checking that 6 = 2 · 3.
1   assert 6 == 2 * 3




                                                                                        ♦
    Remark 3.12. In Exercise 3.11 we could have also used a larger number, say 8,
    9 or 10. See Exercise 3.13.                                                ♦
    Exercise 3.13 (Variant of Exercise 3.11). As stated in Example 3.10, we verify
    that 10 is not prime by checking that 10 = 2 · 5.
2   # Use 10 instead of 6
3   assert 10 == 2 * 5




                                                                                        ♦
    Homework 3.A. Prove that 12 is not a prime number.                                  ♦

Including aux files

  • In book mode aux the user is expected to provide a \includechapter
    command for every chapter. This will generate the aux files that will be
    used in presentation mode too. To speed up the compilation the user can
    temporarily comment out some chapters, or include them only as aux files
    (provided that those files were generated by a previous compilation) by
    providing the optional argument aux-only.
  • In presentation mode the command \includechapter automatically in-
    cludes aux files for all chapters, even when a single chapter is included.
    The command does not accept any optional argument.

   Sample citations from the chapter_6_requires.tex file (which is not ac-
tually included in this document): chapter A, equation A.1, (A.2).
