Theorem-like environments

Theorem 3.1 (Pythagoras). For a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse
c, we have
                             a2 + b2 = c2 .
Definition 3.2 (Prime Number). A prime number is an integer greater than 1
that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Example 3.3 (Small Primes). The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.

Lemma 3.4 (Divisibility Property). If a prime p divides the product ab, then
p divides a or p divides b.
Proposition 3.5 (Infinitude of Primes). There are infinitely many prime num-
bers.

Proof. Assume there are finitely many primes p1 , . . . , pn . Consider

                                P = p1 p2 · · · pn + 1.

Then P is either prime itself or divisible by a prime not in the list. In either
case, there exists a prime not in {p1 , . . . , pn }, contradicting finiteness. Hence,
there are infinitely many primes.
Remark 3.6 (Euclid). The proof of the infinitude of primes, originally due to
Euclid, is one of the oldest and most elegant arguments in mathematics.
Example 3.7 (Non-Prime Numbers). The integers 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not prime,
since each can be expressed as a product of smaller integers.
