Some results (I)

Theorem 3.1 (Pythagoras)
For a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c, we have

                                                  a2 + b2 = c2 .


Definition 3.2 (Prime Number)
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Example 3.3 (Small Primes)
The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.

Lemma 3.4 (Divisibility Property)
If a prime p divides the product ab, then p divides a or p divides b.

Proposition 3.5 (Infinitude of Primes)
There are infinitely many prime numbers.

Proof
Assume there are finitely many primes p1 , . . . , pn . Consider

                                            P = p1 p2 · · · pn + 1.

Then P is either prime itself or divisible by a prime not in the list. In either case, there exists a prime
not in {p1 , . . . , pn }, contradicting finiteness. Hence, there are infinitely many primes.

Remark 3.6 (Euclid)
The proof of the infinitude of primes, originally due to Euclid, is one of the oldest and most elegant
arguments in mathematics.

Example 3.7 (Non-Prime Numbers)
The integers 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not prime, since each can be expressed as a product of smaller integers.
