Including aux files

 • In book mode aux the user is expected to provide a \includechapter command for every chapter.
    This will generate the aux files that will be used in presentation mode too. To speed up the
    compilation the user can temporarily comment out some chapters, or include them only as aux files
    (provided that those files were generated by a previous compilation) by providing the optional
    argument aux-only.
 • In presentation mode the command \includechapter automatically includes aux files for all
    chapters, even when a single chapter is included. The command does not accept any optional
    argument.
Sample citations from the chapter_6_requires.tex file (which is not actually included in this
document): chapter A, equation A.1, (A.2).
