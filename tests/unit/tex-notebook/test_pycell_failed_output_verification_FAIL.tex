\chapter{Case with output mismatch}

LaTeX compilation will fail if the python code does not return the expected output.

\begin{pycell}
2 + 2
\end{pycell}
\begin{pyexpectedoutput}
3
\end{pyexpectedoutput}

\chapter{Cases without expected output}

Setting the expected output is not mandatory if the cell doesn't produce any output.

\begin{pycell}
a = 5
\end{pycell}

However, forgetting to declare the expected output for a cell that returns some output will result in a compilation error.
\begin{pycell}
3 + 3
\end{pycell}
