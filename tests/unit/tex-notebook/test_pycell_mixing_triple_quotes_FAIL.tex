\chapter{Mixing triple quotes}

Once can print multiline strings defined using either triple single quotes or triple double quotes. The entire code cell is passed to python by wrapping it in a string, which is multiline and uses the other quote type to avoid having to escape quotes internally.

\begin{pycell}
Z = """three
THREE_Three"""
N = """FoUr_four
quattro_cuatro"""
print("\n".join([Z, N]))
\end{pycell}
\begin{pyexpectedoutput}
three
THREE_Three
FoUr_four
quattro_cuatro
\end{pyexpectedoutput}

\begin{pycell}
Z = '''three
THREE_Three'''
N = '''FoUr_four
quattro_cuatro'''
print("\n".join([Z, N]))
\end{pycell}
\begin{pyexpectedoutput}
three
THREE_Three
FoUr_four
quattro_cuatro
\end{pyexpectedoutput}

However, one cannot mix the two, because it would not be possible to quote the code to be passed to python without escaping.
\begin{pycell}
Z = """three
THREE_Three"""
N = '''FoUr_four
quattro_cuatro'''
print("\n".join([Z, N]))
\end{pycell}
